### Opentelemetry Collector

version of Collector: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.29.0

As described in the [Opentelemetry Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/components/)  
The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, process, and export telemetry data. It removes the need to run, operate, and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source observability data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) sending to one or more open-source or commercial back-ends. The Collector is the default location instrumentation libraries export their telemetry data.

`Only` tracing is configured for telemetry at the moment.
The Collector configuration is located [here](https://github.com/niko-achilles/otlp-logzio-fullstack/blob/main/observability/collector/collector-config.example.yaml)

```yml
# define receivers, eg. otlp with supported protocols grpc, http
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
        # USE FOR CORS
        # cors_allowed_origins:
        #   - http://*
        #   - https://*

# define exporters, eg. jaeger
# if you use logzio, define logzio
exporters:
  jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger-all-in-one:14250
    insecure: true
  # setup a logzio account and get a logzio tracing token
  logzio:
    account_token: "your-token"
    region: "your-region"

# define span processors
processors:
  batch:

# define services and pipelines for traces
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [jaeger]
      # OR use as exporters in case you have a logzio account
      # exporters: [jaeger,logzio]
```
