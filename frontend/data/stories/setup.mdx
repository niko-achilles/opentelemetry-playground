# 1. Getting opentelemetry collector configured.

The Collector configuration is located [here](https://github.com/niko-achilles/otlp-logzio-fullstack/blob/main/observability/collector/collector-config.example.yaml)

`Only` tracing is configured for telemetry at the moment.  
But feel free to adjust the configuration to your needs, then

`Rename` the configuration file to `collector-config.yml`

# 2. Composing with Docker

Have Docker installed on your machine.

Composing, building and running, the `docker-compose` file
defines in a `declerative way` the containers that should be builded,
in which order builded, and run in the same `network`.

The docker-compose file is located [here](https://github.com/niko-achilles/otlp-logzio-fullstack/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

Command: `docker-compose up --build`

You should see similar to this in your terminal.  
The `State` should have a value of `Up` indicating that the components are up and running

```zsh
           Name                          Command               State                                        Ports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stories_api_1                 docker-entrypoint.sh npm r ...   Up      0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp,:::5000->5000/tcp
stories_collector_1           /otelcontribcol --config=/ ...   Up      55679/tcp, 55680/tcp, 0.0.0.0:55681->55681/tcp,:::55681->55681/tcp
stories_frontend_1            docker-entrypoint.sh yarn  ...   Up      0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp,:::3000->3000/tcp
stories_jaeger-all-in-one_1   /go/bin/all-in-one-linux         Up      0.0.0.0:49154->14250/tcp,:::49154->14250/tcp,
                                                                       0.0.0.0:49153->14268/tcp,:::49153->14268/tcp,
                                                                       0.0.0.0:16686->16686/tcp,:::16686->16686/tcp, 5775/udp, 5778/tcp, 6831/udp,
                                                                       6832/udp
stories_postgres_1            docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      5432/tcp
```

# 3. Validating collected telemetry data for tracing

Jaeger tracing data

Command:  
Open `http://localhost:16686`
You should see similar to this, in the service tab the services with the name `story_views_api` and `NEXTJS APP`

![](/images/api-postgres-frontend-tracing.png)

Command:  
Select `story_views_api` and hit on `find traces`.  
You should see similar to this:

![](/images/api-postgres-tracing-data.png)

Frontend tracing data in the browser console

Command:  
Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and  
Open `Web developer tools`, `console` tab.

You should see similar to this:

# 4. Stopping containers

Command:  
`docker-compose down` , then  
you should see similar to this, indicating that the containers are stopped:

```bash
Stopping stories_frontend_1          ... done
Stopping stories_api_1               ... done
Stopping stories_postgres_1          ... done
Stopping stories_collector_1         ... done
Stopping stories_jaeger-all-in-one_1 ... done
Removing stories_frontend_1          ... done
Removing stories_api_1               ... done
Removing stories_postgres_1          ... done
Removing stories_collector_1         ... done
Removing stories_jaeger-all-in-one_1 ... done
Removing network stories_default
```
